The dataset is called Bloom and it's collected by [SIL](https://www.sil.org/).

Bloom is free, open-source software and an associated website [Bloom Library](https://bloomlibrary.org/), app, and services developed by [SIL International](https://www.sil.org/). Bloomâ€™s primary goal is to equip non-dominant language communities and their members to create the literature they want for their community and children. Bloom also serves organizations that help such communities develop literature and education or other aspects of community development.
